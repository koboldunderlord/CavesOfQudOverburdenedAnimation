# CavesOfQudOverburdenedAnimation
NOTE: Requires HarmonyLib from latest beta to run! Does not work with current standard release.

Adds a QOL animation similar to the Rubbergum Injector for anyone who is overburdened, which is especially useful for followers.

Shoutouts: Thanks to IRID1UM for the idea, and thanks to Armithaig, helado and exsanguination microtubules for modding help!
